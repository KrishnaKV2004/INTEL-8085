# Intel 8085 Simulator

## Overview

This project is a simulator for the Intel 8085 microprocessor. The Intel 8085 is an 8-bit microprocessor introduced by Intel in the mid-1970s. It became one of the most popular microprocessors of its time and was widely used in various applications including embedded systems, industrial automation, and personal computers.

The simulator allows users to emulate the behavior of the Intel 8085 microprocessor, executing instructions and interacting with memory and I/O devices. It provides a platform for learning, experimentation, and development of software for the Intel 8085 architecture.
