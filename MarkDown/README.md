# Intel 8085 Simulator

## Overview

This project is a simulator for the Intel 8085 microprocessor. The Intel 8085 is an 8-bit microprocessor introduced by Intel in the mid-1970s. It became one of the most popular microprocessors of its time and was widely used in various applications including embedded systems, industrial automation, and personal computers.

The simulator allows users to emulate the behavior of the Intel 8085 microprocessor, executing instructions and interacting with memory and I/O devices. It provides a platform for learning, experimentation, and development of software for the Intel 8085 architecture.

## INTEL 8085 Overview

The Intel 8085 is an 8-bit microprocessor with a 16-bit address bus. It operates at various clock speeds depending on the specific version. The instruction set architecture includes various data movement, arithmetic, logic, and control instructions. The processor has a set of general-purpose registers, including the accumulator and six other registers.

Some key characteristics of the Intel 8085 microprocessor -->

- Clock speed: Typically operates at frequencies ranging from 2 to 3.125 MHz
- Instruction set: Includes over 100 instructions supporting data manipulation, control  flow, and I/O operations
- Registers: Accumulator (A), six general-purpose registers (B, C, D, E, H, L), stack pointer (SP), and program counter (PC)
- Addressing modes: Supports various addressing modes including direct, indirect, and immediate addressing

For more detailed information about the Intel 8085 microprocessor, refer to the official Intel documentation or other resources available online.
